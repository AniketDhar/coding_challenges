# Coding Challenge: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Example

**Example 1:**

```cpp
string s = "abcabcbb";
Output: 3 (The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.)
```

**Example 2:**

```cpp
string s = "bbbbb";
Output: 1 (The answer is "b", with the length of 1.)
```

**Example 3:**

```cpp
string s = "pwwkew";
Output: 3 (The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.)
```

**Example 4:**

```cpp
string s = "";
Output: 0 (The length of the longest substring without repeating characters is 0.)
```
